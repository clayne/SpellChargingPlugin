# SpellChargingPlugin
A mod that enables overcharging of (almost) all spells in Skyrim Special Edition, including mod-added spells.

## Main Features
* Overcharge spells by holding down the cast button
* * Increase damage, healing, armor from Alteration spells, max level for Illusion spells, or their respective durations
* * Projectile-based spells or area-of-effect spells also get a slight boost to their radius and speed
* Drains Magicka for each charge
* Visual indicator of how many charges you have accumulated
* Option to toggle between modes, letting you overcharge only Magnitude or Duration
* Highly configurable (aka DIY balancing)
* Entirely script-free, resulting in low latency and little impact on performance
* Contained inside one single DLL plugin
* Safe to install and remove at any point
